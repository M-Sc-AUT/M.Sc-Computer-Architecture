Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among the most widely used models in the field of deep learning, particularly in applications such as image recognition and visual data processing. Given the growing demand for fast and efficient processing, hardware platforms like FPGA have become an ideal choice for implementing these networks due to their parallel processing capabilities and low power consumption.

In this project, the goal was to implement a Convolutional Neural Network for handwritten digit recognition on an FPGA using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The implementation process consisted of two main phases: In the software phase, the network was trained, and its weights were stored. In the hardware phase, the stored weights were transferred to the FPGA, and the input data was fed into the network. The outputs were then processed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of recognition. This implementation combines the high efficiency and flexibility of FPGA with the power of deep learning, enabling enhanced productivity in practical applications.

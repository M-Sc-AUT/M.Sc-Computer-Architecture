In today's world, the discussion of IoT is one of the growing issues in human life. The speed of this growth has been particularly significant in recent years, and it is predicted that this progress will continue with even greater strides in the future. The issue of power and energy in IoT systems is one of the important issues in the proper use of them. Many IoT applications in various industries, due to the issue of power supply required for operation, despite the existence of solutions for other challenges, have not yet been commercially introduced to the market. By solving the power supply issue, a large market awaits IoT devices. This topic has been examined in this research by leveraging recent studies and articles, comparing different power supply models, and using energy harvesting methods from the environment.
